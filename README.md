## Documentation

中文文档：[https://takler.readthedocs.io/](https://takler.readthedocs.io/)

## History

Takler was a work project started from 2014, when I started the second work year at NWPC.
I tried to implement a simple job scheduling software with basic features of ecFlow.

Since 2022, takler project is totally rewritten with asyncio and gRPC.
The purpose is to create a workflow tool for both operation and experiment users.
