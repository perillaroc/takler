## Documentation

Chinese documentation (中文文档)：[https://takler.readthedocs.io/](https://takler.readthedocs.io/)

## History

Takler was a work project created at 2014, when I spend the second work year at NWPC/CMA.
I tried to implement a simple task scheduling tool with basic features of ecFlow.

Since 2022, takler project is totally rewritten with asyncio and gRPC.
The purpose is to create a workflow tool for both operation and experiment users.
