## Documentation

Chinese documentation (中文文档)：[https://takler.readthedocs.io/](https://takler.readthedocs.io/)

## History

Takler was initially developed in 2014 during perillaroc's second year at NWPC/CMA as a work project 
aimed at implementing a lightweight task scheduling tool inspired by the basic features of [ecFlow](https://github.com/ecmwf/ecflow).

Since 2022, the project has undergone a complete redesign, 
now built on [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html) and [gRPC](https://grpc.io/). 
The current objective is to provide a workflow management system that supports both operational and experimental use cases.
